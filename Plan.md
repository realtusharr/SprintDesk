### **SprintDesk — Sprint Management Dashboard** 

**Role:** Frontend Engineer 

**Submission:** Public GitHub Repository + Live Deployment + Screen Recording 

#### **1. Assignment Overview** 

As part of our frontend engineering evaluation process, you are required to build **SprintDesk** , a sprint management dashboard designed for software development teams. 

The assignment is intended to evaluate your ability to build a production-oriented React application with: 

- Clean and scalable architecture 

- Strong TypeScript practices 

- Effective state management 

- Server-state management 

- Interactive drag-and-drop functionality 

- Data visualization 

- Reusable UI components 

- Authentication and protected routes 

- Responsive design 

- Accessibility 

- Performance optimization 

- Testing 

- Real-world problem solving 

This is not intended to be a tutorial-style implementation. We are looking for the level of engineering quality, decision-making, and attention to detail that would be expected from a frontend engineer working on a production application. 

#### **2. Important Candidate Guidance** 

The assignment is intentionally challenging for the target experience level. 

We value: 

- Code Quality 

- Good architectural decisions 

- Clean and maintainable code 

- Thoughtful prioritisation 

- Proper handling of edge cases 

- Responsive and accessible UI 

- Clear documentation of technical decisions 

A focused and well-executed implementation is preferable to a rushed implementation containing incomplete or unreliable features. 

If you are unable to complete a requirement, document the limitation clearly in the README and explain what you would implement or improve with additional time. 

# **3. Problem Statement** 

You are building **SprintDesk** , a single-page sprint management application for software teams. 

The application should provide a central workspace where users can: 

- Authenticate securely 

- Manage sprint tasks through a Kanban board 

- Drag and reorder tasks 

- View task details 

- Create and delete tasks 

- Analyze sprint data 

- Receive notifications 

- Switch between light and dark themes 

- Use a consistent component system 

The application should behave like a real-world product rather than a static UI demonstration.

## **06. Application Routes** 

The application must contain at least four distinct routes. 

The recommended structure is: 

- /login 

- /dashboard 

- /board 

- /analytics 

Authenticated routes must be protected. 

## **07. Standards & Evaluation Criteria** 

The following requirements apply to the **entire application** and will be considered during evaluation in addition to the functional requirements listed above. 

###### **7.1 Scope Discipline — No Unnecessary Features** 

Candidates are expected to implement **only the features explicitly mentioned in this assignment** . 

The implementation may include: 

- Required features 

- Clearly marked Bonus features 

Candidates should **not add unrelated features, screens, workflows, libraries, or functionality** that are not part of the assignment. 

###### **Dead Code** 

The submitted repository must not contain unnecessary or unused code. 

This includes: 

- Unused components 

- Unused hooks 

- Unused utilities 

- Unused imports 

- Unused variables 

- Commented-out old implementations 

- Unused API functions 

- Duplicate components 

- Unused dependencies 

- Abandoned experimental code 

###### **Dead code and unnecessary implementation will be considered negative during evaluation.** 

Candidates should remove unused code before submission. 

#### **7.2 State Management** 

The application must demonstrate **proper state management across the entire application** . 

Candidates should identify the appropriate type of state and manage it using the correct approach. 

At minimum, the implementation should clearly separate: 

###### **Server State** 

Server/API-related state should be handled using **TanStack Query v5** , including: 

- API requests 

- Loading states 

- Error states 

- Caching 

- Refetching 

- Polling 

- Request lifecycle 

- Query invalidation where appropriate 

###### **Client/Application State** 

Application-level client state should be handled using **Zustand** where appropriate, including: 

- Authentication state 

- Kanban board state 

- Notifications 

- Theme state 

- UI/application state that needs to be shared across components 

###### **Local Component State** 

Component-level state should remain local when global state is unnecessary. 

Candidates should avoid: 

- Prop drilling through multiple unrelated components 

- Duplicating the same state in multiple places 

- Using Zustand for every piece of local UI state 

- Using React Context as a replacement for proper application state management 

- Storing server state unnecessarily inside Zustand 

#### **7.3 API Integration & Data Abstraction** 

The assignment is also intended to evaluate the candidate's **API integration architecture** , not only whether API requests work. 

The provided mock data should be treated as a temporary data source that represents a real backend. 

Candidates must avoid coupling UI components directly to the mock JSON structure. 

###### **Required Approach** 

API communication should be organized through a dedicated API/service/data-access layer. 

For example: 

UI Components 

↓ 

Hooks / Query Layer 

↓ 

API / Service Layer 

↓ 

Data Source 

↓ 

Mock JSON / Real API 

The UI should not directly contain logic such as: 

fetch('/mock-data.json') 

throughout multiple components. 

Instead, API access should be centralized so that replacing the mock data source with a real backend requires **minimal or no changes to the UI layer** . 

###### **Dynamic API Requirement** 

Candidates should implement the application using dynamic data access patterns. 

The provided JSON data should simulate backend responses. The implementation should be structured so that the mock data source can later be replaced with real API endpoints. 

#### **7.4 Provided Mock Data** 

A mock-data.json file will be provided with the assignment. 

Candidates are expected to use this data as the initial data source for the application wherever applicable. 

The provided data may contain mock representations of: 

- Users 

- Authentication-related user data. 

- Sprint tasks 

- Task details 

- Comments 

- Notifications 

- Analytics-related data 

- Assignees 

- Other data required by the application flows 

###### Candidates must **not modify the provided mock data simply to make the UI work around an implementation issue** . 

If the application requires additional derived data, the candidate should generate or transform it through the appropriate service/state layer. 

Mock-data.json is the primary application data source for users, sprints, tasks, comments, and initial notification data. DummyJSON is used for authentication and token refresh. JSONPlaceholder is used only for simulated notification polling.
